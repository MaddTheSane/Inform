/// This ensures inspectors are laid out from the top to bottom and not vice-versa, which means the
/// window doesn't 'move' downwards when inspectors are closed. Used as the content view of the
/// inspector window.
///
/// The 'Is' from the prefix 'IFIs' stands for 'Inspector System', as opposed to being part of
/// isFlipped.
