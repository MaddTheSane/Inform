    <p class="sectionheading">ยง13.10. Defining new prepositions</p>
    <p>The term preposition is used here, a little loosely, to mean anything which we add to the verb <span class="italic">to be</span> in order to talk about some relation or other. We have seen many examples already, such as:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3985"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3985"></a>To be in - The ball is in the box.
    <br>
    To be part of - The lever is part of the slot machine.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>These are defined just the way verbs are. Compare the following:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3986"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3986"></a>Suspicion relates various people to one person.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3987"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3987"></a>The verb to suspect means the suspicion relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <!--START CODE "c3988"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3988"></a>The verb to be suspicious of means the suspicion relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>The result of this is that</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3989"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3989"></a>Hercule Poirot suspects Colonel Hotchkiss.
    <br>
    Hercule Poirot is suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>are exactly equivalent, and so are these two descriptions:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3990"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3990"></a>somebody who suspects Colonel Hotchkiss
    <br>
    somebody suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>While most prepositions are short (&quot;in&quot;, &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;suspicious of&quot;), they're free to be longer if need be (&quot;inordinately far away from&quot;): the limit is 30 words, which should be ample.</p>
    <p>We can also define verbs as auxiliaries, like so:</p>
    <!--START CODE "c3991"-->
    <blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted"><a id="c3991"></a>The verb to be able to approach means the approachability relation.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!--END CODE-->
    <p>Now we can ask if Poirot &quot;can approach&quot; Hotchkiss, and so on.</p>
