<p>Inform's &quot;door&quot; kind provides for a tangible thing which comes between one room and another. A door can be open or closed, and openable or not: it can be locked or unlocked, and lockable or not. Here we create a conventional door, a natural gap in the rocks, and a (fixed in place) wooden ladder:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10203" -->
<a id="c10203"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The fire door is an open door. The fire door is east of the Projection Booth and west of the Fire Escape.
<br />The narrow crevice is an open unopenable door. The crevice is east of the Col du Prafleuri and west of Rocky Knoll Above Arolla.
<br />The wooden ladder is an open unopenable door. The ladder is above the Stableyard and below the Hay Loft.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Most doors are visible from both sides: they are single objects but present in two rooms at once, which raises a number of complications. Inform normally uses the same description looking from each way, which is not very interesting: <span class="boldface">When?</span> and <span class="boldface">Whence?</span> demonstrate neat ways to describe the two sides differently, and <span class="boldface">Whither?</span> adds the option for the player to refer to doors as &quot;the west door&quot; and &quot;the east door&quot; automatically.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Neighbourhood Watch</span> goes further by making a door behave differently on each side: from the &quot;outside&quot; you need a key, but &quot;inside&quot; it opens on a latch. Finally, <span class="boldface">Garibaldi 1</span> shows how to access information about the two sides of a door.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Higher Calling</span> demonstrates doors which automatically open as needed: though using the Inform extension Locksmith by Emily Short is probably easier and better. <span class="boldface">Elsie</span>, conversely, demonstrates a door that closes one turn after the player has opened it.</p>
<p>Certain complications apply when characters other than the player have to see and interact with doors that exist in other rooms. <span class="boldface">Wainwright Acts</span> demonstrates the syntax needed to handle this technically quirky situation.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Something Narsty</span> and <span class="boldface">Hayseed</span> provide a &quot;staircase&quot; kind useful for vertically arranged, always-open doors like staircases and (fixed in place) ladders.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">One Short Plank</span> implements a precarious plank bridge across a chasm as an open unopenable door.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to write rules for a character who will interact with doors in other locations even when the player is not present. This poses a little challenge: doors are actually single objects, and -- with the same shuffling of stage properties that applies to backdrops -- they are moved as needed to represent the door object in whatever room contains the player.</p>
<p>That means that it isn't safe to rely on a phrase like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10221_418" -->
<a id="c10221_418"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if an open door is in the location of Bernard
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because, even if Bernard's location is connected by doors to other places, the actual representation of that door may not be &quot;in&quot; Bernard's location, from the model's point of view, at this exact moment.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, mean that we can't ask this question; just that we have to be a little cleverer about how we phrase it. Every door has properties that correspond to the two locations</p>
<p>linked:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10222_418" -->
<a id="c10222_418"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the front side of the blue door (a room, which is arbitrarily one side of the door)
<br />the back side of the blue door (arbitrarily the other side)
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can make this information easier to check with a conditional relation, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10223_418" -->
<a id="c10223_418"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Liminality relates a door (called X) to a room (called Y) when the front side of X is Y or the back side of X is Y. The verb to be a threshold of means the liminality relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And this allows us to write rules that have characters interacting with doors even in the player's absence:</p>

<p>The next part is going to require that we modify the normal operation of the &quot;lock&quot; command. &quot;Lock&quot; ordinarily requires that the player supply two objects: a thing he wants to unlock, and the key he wants to use on it. The full command is LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, and Inform will not accept simply LOCK DOOR as locking.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're going to need to create our own new variant on the lock verb (and the unlock verb, while we're at it). The full procedure for this is laid out in the chapters on Action and Understanding, but here is an example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10242_101" -->
<a id="c10242_101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;lock [something]&quot; as locking keylessly. Locking keylessly is an action applying to one thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we've created a new action -- locking something without a key -- and we've told Inform to understand LOCK DOOR as this action, rather than an incomplete command to LOCK DOOR WITH SOMETHING.</p>
<p>Now we add some instructions so that the game will not let us use this keyless unlocking command unless we're in the right place or are properly equipped:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c10243_101" -->
<a id="c10243_101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Check locking keylessly:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is not a door, say &quot;[The noun] is not something you can lock.&quot; instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is locked, say &quot;[The noun] is already locked.&quot; instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player carries the brass key and the player is in the Stairwell, try locking the noun with the brass key instead;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is in the Stairwell, say &quot;You can't lock the door from this side without the key.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This check rule is performed before the keyless locking action succeeds. The first thing we do is try to use the key if the player is outside and has the key: this way, LOCK DOOR will turn automatically into LOCK DOOR WITH THE KEY, under circumstances where that is both possible and necessary.</p>
<p>The second thing is to check whether the player is outside but keyless, and, if so stop the action from being performed successfully. Here we print a failure message followed by the word &quot;instead&quot;, which tells Inform that we've substituted some other outcome for the usual performance of the action.</p>
<p>Now we're reasonably sure that the player is only locking keylessly in the case that he is inside the Studio. (We might have to do a more thorough check for this if there were more than two rooms, but as it is, the player can only be in the Stairwell or in the Studio, so if we have ruled out the Stairwell, we are safe.)

<p>That's it. We've just told Inform to make the door be locked. &quot;Now...&quot; syntax will be explained more thoroughly in the chapter on change. But we still haven't described to the player what just happened, so let's provide a description of that, too:</p>

<p>It would be fairly tedious reading to have a large game full of doors that describe themselves this way. Nonetheless, if we insisted we could use our knowledge of the map as leverage to make every door in the game describe itself automatically.</p>
<p>To do this, we make use of the phrase &quot;direction of (the door) from (a room)&quot; -- in this case, the direction of the door we're looking at when viewed from the player's location. Thus:</p>
