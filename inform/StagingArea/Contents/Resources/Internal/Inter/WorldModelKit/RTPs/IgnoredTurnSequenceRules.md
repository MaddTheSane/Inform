# Attempt to ignore the turn sequence rules

Ignoring the turn sequence rulebook would cause the story file to hang, that is, to remain indefinitely in an unresponsive state.

(This wasn't always true: until February 2008, the turn sequence rules did not include command parsing and action generation, so that a form of play could continue even without the turn sequence rulebook. Now, however, more delicate control is needed to achieve such effects: usually putting new rules into the turn sequence rulebook at strategic points to end it early.)
