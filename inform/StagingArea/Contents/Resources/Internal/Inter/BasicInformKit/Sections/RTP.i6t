RTP Template.

To issue run-time problem messages, and to perform some run-time
type checking which may issue such messages.

@h Reporting.
All RTPs are produced by calling the following routine, which takes one
compulsory argument: |n|, the RTP number. When I7 is being used with the
Inform user interface, it's important that these numbers correspond to the
explanatory web pages stored within the interface application: those in
turn are created by the |inrtps| utility. The interface knows to display
these pages because it parses the printed output during play to look for
the text layout produced by the following routine: so do not reformat
RTPs without ensuring that corresponding changes have been made to the
Inform user interface applications.

The arguments |par1|, |par2| and |par3| are optional parameters clarifying the
message; |ln| is an optional parameter specifying a paragraph number in the
original source text (though in fact I7 does not use this at present).

@h Low-Level Errors.
The following is a residue from the old I6 library, and most of its possible
messages can't be seen in I7 use -- for instance I7 has no timers or daemons,
so error 4 is out of the question. But we retain the routine because the
veneer code added by I6 requires it to be present.

=
Constant MAX_TIMERS = 0;
[ RunTimeError n p1 p2;
    #Ifdef DEBUG;
    print "** Library error ", n, " (", p1, ",", p2, ") **^** ";
    switch (n) {
      1:    print "preposition not found (this should not occur)";
      2:    print "Property value not routine or string: ~", (property) p2, "~ of ~", (name) p1,
                  "~ (", p1, ")";
      3:    print "Entry in property list not routine or string: ~", (property) p2, "~ list of ~",
                  (name) p1, "~ (", p1, ")";

@h Argument Type Checking Failed.
This is called when run-time type checking for the argument of a phrase
fails, so that no definition for the phrase can be applied.

=
[ ArgumentTypeFailed line file;
	RunTimeProblem(RTP_TYPECHECK, 0, 0, 0, line, file);
];

@h Return Type Checking Failed.
Similarly, though in a more restricted set of circumstances. Inform can usually
prove that the value returned by a phrase matches its supposed kind, but
because of the deliberately weak type-checking within the kind of value
"object" it will allow a broader kind of object to be returned when the
requirement is for a narrower one. In such cases, it checks the result with
the following routine. The value |V| is a valid "object", but that means
it can be |nothing|, and we must check that it matches a given I7 kind |K|
(where |nothing| is not valid).

=
[ CheckKindReturned V K;
	if (V ofclass K) return V;
	if (V == nothing) RunTimeProblem(RTP_DECIDEONNOTHING);
	else RunTimeProblem(RTP_DECIDEONWRONGKIND);
	return V;
];

@h Whether Provides.
This routine defines the phrase "if O provides P": there are three tests
to pass, and if any of the three fail, we return |false|. (The |issue_rtp|
flag, causing RTPs to be issued depending on which test fails, is never set
when the routine is simply testing the condition.)

Firstly, P has to be a property known to I7. Secondly, there has to be
permission either for this individual object to have it, or for its kind to
have it, or its kind's kind, and so on. Thirdly, the object has to actually
have the property in question at an I6 level -- having permission to have
it doesn't mean it actually does have.

=
[ ProvidesProperty K obj q issue_rtp  a l holder;
	if (K == OBJECT_TY) {
		if (ScanPropertyMetadata(obj, q, 4)) jump PermissionFound;
		if (obj provides KD_Count) {
			l = obj.KD_Count;
			while (l > 0) {
				a = l*2;
				if (ScanPropertyMetadata(KindHierarchy-->a, q, 4)) jump PermissionFound;
				l = KindHierarchy-->(a+1);
			}
		}
		if (ScanPropertyMetadata(K0_kind, q, 4)) jump PermissionFound;
		if (issue_rtp) RunTimeProblem(RTP_UNPROVIDED, obj, q);
		rfalse;
	}

	.PermissionFound;
	if (K >> obj provides q) rtrue;

	if (issue_rtp) RunTimeProblem(RTP_UNSET, obj, q);
	rfalse;
];

[ PrintPropertyName  p  textual;
	if (p<0) p = ~p;
	textual = p-->3;
	print (string) textual;
];

@h Scan Property Metadata.
The supplied metadata table is a series of zero-terminated lists of objects
(or class objects, representing I7 kinds). Each such list corresponds to a single
property; the position in the table is called the "offset" for the property.
The following searches from a given offset.

=
[ ScanPropertyMetadata obj property_metadata off i;
	for (i=off: property_metadata-->i >= 0: i++)
		if (obj == property_metadata-->i) rtrue;
	rfalse;
];

@h Read Property.
Some value properties belong to other values (those created in tables), and
these are stored indirectly through a pseudo-object |V| -- an I6 object which
is not part of the world model, and not a valid I7 "object" value, but which is
used in order that properties belonging to values
are still I6 property numbers. |V.P| is the table column address for this
property; |obj| is then a value for the kind of value created by the table, so
it is used as an index into the table column to get the address of the memory
location storing the property value.

=
[ GProperty K V pr err holder val;
	if (ProvidesProperty(K, V, pr, 1-err)) {
		return (K >> V . pr);
	}
	return 0;
];

@h Write Property.
This routine's name must consist of the read-value-property routine's name
with the prefix |Write|, as that is how a reference to such a property is
converted from an rvalue to an lvalue.

=
[ WriteGProperty K V pr val holder;
	if (ProvidesProperty(K, V, pr, true)) {
		K >> V . pr = val;
	}
];

@h Printing Property Names.
Inform doesn't print property names prettily; it more or less prints them
only as decimal numbers.

=
[ PROPERTY_TY_Say v;
	print "property ", v;
];
