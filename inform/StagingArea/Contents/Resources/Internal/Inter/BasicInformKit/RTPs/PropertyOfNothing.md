# Attempt to use a property of nothing

The special value `nothing` is used to mean no object at all, and sometimes appears where an object might be expected if it was impossible to find a genuine object, or no genuine object was specified.

`nothing` is not an object in its own right, and so it makes no sense to look at its properties.
